# WDE Exam Prep

## Instructions

Copy the table below into your own journal. 
Next to each objective, give yourself a "confidence score" that represents how confident
you feel that you will get a question about that topic right. Use a letter grade scale (A means you are very confident you will get a question
about that topic correct, E means that you are very confident you will get a question about that topic wrong).

This is a completion activity and I won't use your confidence scores to calculate any grade - so feel free to be honest!

We'll use this to inform our study plan for the test.
